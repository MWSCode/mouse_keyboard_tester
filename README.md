# Mouse and Keyboard Tester

This tool captures and shows various mouse and keyboard events and shows them. This can be useful if you write a new JavaScript software and want to know the character code of a specific key, see what each JavaScript event function does, or just test your mouse and keyboard.

It uses no frameworks, no additional files, just a single HTML-file containing everything needed: CSS, JavaScript, Images, even Font-files!

This tool includes these languages: English and Farsi.
The layout is based on inline-block technique.
